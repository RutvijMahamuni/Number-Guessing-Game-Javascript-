Hello visitor!<br/>
This is the code for a small. fun game I build as a project for <b><i>Javascript</i></b> course. It contatins the HTML, CSS and javascript files for the game.<br/>
Along with javascript, this game also helped me to understand and revise the concepts about **HTML** and **CSS**.<br/>
<b>Hope you enjoy!!!<b>
